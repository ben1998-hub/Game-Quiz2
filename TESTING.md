## Defensive Programming




.

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

| Page | Expectation | Test | Result | Fix | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | | | | | |
| | Feature is expected to do nothing when the user does an incorrect input | Tested the feature by doing lots of incorrect inputs | The feature behaved as expected, | Test concluded and passed | ![screenshot](documentation/p1.png) |
